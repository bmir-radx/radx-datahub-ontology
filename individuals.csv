"Individual","RADx","DATAHUB:0002002","RADx","","RADx stands for Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics. It’s a program launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2020, as part of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of RADx was to accelerate the development, commercialization, and deployment of innovative diagnostic technologies—especially for COVID-19 testing.","The primary goals of RADx include:

1. Accelerating the development, validation, and commercialization of innovative COVID-19 testing technologies
2. Expanding testing capacity and accessibility across the United States
3. Supporting the rapid deployment of accurate, reliable, and user-friendly testing solutions
4. Addressing testing needs for diverse populations and settings

RADx encompasses several coordinated programs:
- RADx Tech: Focuses on early-stage test development through commercialization
- RADx Advanced Technology Platforms (RADx-ATP): Scales up more mature testing technologies
- RADx Radical (RADx-rad): Supports innovative, non-traditional approaches to testing
- RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP): Addresses testing disparities in vulnerable communities","","RADx rad
