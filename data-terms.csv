Applied to quasi-identifiers such as:
    - Dates (e.g., replacing birthdates with birth years).
    - Ages (e.g., replacing exact ages with age ranges).
    - Geographic locations (e.g., truncating ZIP codes to the first three digits).

Most often applied to direct identifiers (e.g., name, social security number) and high-risk quasi-identifiers (e.g., rare diagnosis codes in small populations).

May apply to entire records or specific fields within records.

Completely removes values, leaving either a blank, null, or masked entry (e.g., “—” or “[suppressed]”).

May be applied systematically (e.g., removing all phone numbers) or selectively (e.g., suppressing data for small population cells to prevent deductive identification).

Used in combination with generalization, pseudonymization, or other de-identification methods to meet privacy and compliance requirements.","To protect participant privacy, ZIP codes for geographic areas with fewer than 20,000 residents were treated as suppressed data, with the values removed from the dataset before submission to the RADx Data Hub.","","Redacted Data","",""

Applied to postal codes (in the U.S., ZIP codes; in other regions, analogous postal codes).

Reduces precision by removing location granularity, limiting geographic identifiability.

Commonly reduces ZIP codes from 5 digits (e.g., 94110) to 3 digits (e.g., 941).

Based on regulatory standards, such as HIPAA Safe Harbor, which requires ZIP code truncation unless the population in that 3-digit region is too small.

May be combined with suppression if the truncated region contains a population under 20,000, per HIPAA guidelines.","To comply with HIPAA Safe Harbor requirements, the study team provided ZIP code truncated data, removing the last two digits and retaining only the first three digits of each ZIP code.","","Truncated ZIP Data|3-Digit ZIP Data|Geographic Precision-Reduced Data","",""
