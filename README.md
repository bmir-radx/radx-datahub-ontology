# RADx Data Hub Ontology
An ontology that describes the arrangement and meaning of important concepts in the RADx Data Hub.

The RADx Data Hub Ontology provides a formally structured vocabulary to describe key concepts within the RADx Data Hub. The primary purpose of the ontology is to:

1.  **Document key terms used in the Data Hub**  
    The ontology lists and organizes the main types of entities and relationships that are relevant to the RADx Data Hub. This helps ensure that core terms are recorded in a consistent and reusable way.

3. **Clarify the meaning of those terms**
   Each term is defined to reduce confusion and make its intended meaning clear to both technical and non-technical users. This helps support consistent use across teams and tools.

5. **Provide synonyms and alternate labels to support consistent usage**
   The ontology includes common synonyms or alternative names for terms to account for variation in how different groups of users refer to the same thing. This supports alignment across documentation, user interfaces, and data submission processes.

7. **Maintain a glossary of acronyms commonly used in RADx**
   Frequently used acronyms are included as part of the ontology, linked to their full forms and definitions. This helps reduce ambiguity and supports clearer communication across documentation, interfaces, and stakeholder groups.

This shared vocabulary, that is provided and defined by the ontology, serves as the source of truth for terminology used across metadata records, user interfaces, documentation, and program communications.
