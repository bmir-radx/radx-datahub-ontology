Epidemiological Studies:
Studies that investigate the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specific populations.
Often used to understand public health trends and risk factors.
Social and Behavioral Studies:
Studies that explore human behavior, attitudes, and social dynamics.

Applied to date fields (e.g., birth date, enrollment date, test date).

Shifts all dates for a single participant or record by the same offset to preserve internal consistency (e.g., ensuring event sequences stay intact).

Date shifts are often used in combination with other techniques (e.g., generalization, suppression) to meet privacy standards.

Commonly used to meet HIPAA Expert Determination requirements for de-identification when dates are considered quasi-identifiers.","To de-identify participant data, the study team applied a date shift of +117 days, meaning all event dates (e.g., enrollment date, test date) were shifted forward by exactly 117 days for each participant.","","Temporally Offset Data|Date-Offset Data|Shifted Dates Data","",""
