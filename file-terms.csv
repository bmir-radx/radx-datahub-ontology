"Class","digital file","DATAHUB:00000008","","","","A digital file is a digital object that contains encoded information stored in a computer-readable format, organized according to a specific file format and accessible by software applications capable of interpreting that format.","Key aspects of a digital file are:

A digital file exists as a named entity within a digital storage system (e.g., filesystem, repository).

A digital file is encoded in a particular file format (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML, PDF).

A digital file contains structured, semi-structured, or unstructured information.

A digital file requires software capable of interpreting the encoding in order to be meaningfully accessed and understood.

A digital file may contain data, metadata, code, text, images, or other digital content.","The study team submitted each data file as a digital file in CSV format to the RADx Data Hub","","Computer File
